      <h2 class="main-content-title">About</h2>
      <p>After earning my bachelor’s degree in journalism from Delhi University, India I wrote articles and news stories for the Times of India. I decided to continue my education and received a post graduate diploma in human resources.</p>
      <p>Moving into my customer service career I was hired on with Direct TV. I credit my inspiration for transitioning to customer relations and coaching to my instructor that I had while training with them.  She was very passionate and involved with her trainees. I could see the impact of her teaching on my coworkers. I have always had a desire to help people succeed and could see myself fitting well into that role.</p>
      <p>Seeing people succeed in their pursuits matter more to me than any monetary reward. In this regard, training has been a very rewarding experience for me.  When you can have a positive impact on someone’s life, it is not just a profession. It turns into a passion.</p>
      <p>I have taught for a variety of industries from students in school to employees in corporations to mothers entering the workforce.</p>
      <p>A couple of my most proud accomplishments happened while I was working with students.</p>
      <p>I trained a team of 20 students and brought them to a competition for GD pro in group discussion. The total number of students competing were 2,000.  While 5 of them made it to the final round of the top 50 students, one of my students earned third place. I was proud of my students' achievements in competing.</p>
      <p>On a different occasion, I brought another team of students to another college for their first competition in power point presentation.  It felt amazing to see their excitement and sense of achievement when they took first place. I felt I had given them confidence in themselves and in their ability to present their ideas clearly.</p>
      <p>I had received a few certificates during my career as well.</p>
      <p>In Wipro I was awarded a certificate of appreciation for valuable support to talent transformation by VP for achieving 100% graduation rate for all of my training classes between 20-25 employees.</p>
      <p>I was also awarded another certificate for achieving 100% graduation rate for AOL process training.</p>
      <p>I am very proud of receiving these awards. I felt that my coaching was valued and reinforced my passion for transforming the lives of others by providing captivating and effective training.</p>
      <p>As I continue my career journey, I am looking forward to bringing my knowledge, experiences and passion for helping others.</p>
